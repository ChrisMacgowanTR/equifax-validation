Description: 

This is the famous technical documentation. 
This should probablu be loacted in the reead.md filel 
Maybe someday 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview

This is add will help with ingest data validation. It will be used to read the
input file that was used during the ingest process. We will parse the input
and then we will compare the data to the data in the database.

When testing against a sample of Equifax data we are are only selecting a sample size of 15-20 records.
typically we will pull from the top, middle and end of the data set in a random and unified manner.
The Equifax consists of some ~54 million rows - and we are pulling 20, so that is about a
%0.00003704 sample size.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL Notes 

Below are some random queries that we used during development testing of the data. 

SELECT partition, idtype, idvalue, idtypetarget, idvaluetarget, status, hashvalue, systemtrackingid, systemtrackingdate, filepath
    FROM troa_dev.idmap;
    
Select DISTINCT partition, idtype, idtypetarget FROM troa_dev.idmap
    
SELECT * FROM troa_dev.idmap
ORDER BY partition ASC, idtype ASC, idvalue ASC, idtypetarget ASC, idvaluetarget ASC LIMIT 100
    
SELECT * FROM troa_dev.organization_sic 
where partitionid = '53' AND partition = 'Equifax_Domestic' 

SELECT * FROM troa_dev.organization_naics
where partitionid = '18847931' AND partition = 'Equifax_Domestic' 

SELECT * FROM troa_dev.organization_sic
ORDER BY sourceid ASC, sourceidtype ASC, sicorder ASC LIMIT 100
